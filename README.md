# Personal-Loan-Campaign
AllLife Bank, a U.S.-based bank, wants to grow its loan business by converting more of its current deposit (liability) customers into personal loan (asset) customers. A past campaign showed a 9% conversion rate, which encouraged the bank to pursue targeted marketing strategies to boost this number.
